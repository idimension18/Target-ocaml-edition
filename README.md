# Target-ocaml-edition
the same Target as usual, but in ocaml this time !

# TODO
I have to improve the makefile even more : 
1 : Generate all mli file related to modules
2 : Generate main.cmo thanks to mli files
3 : Generate all .cmo files after all mli was processed into main.cmo
4 : Build the game into an executable
